# CS261-Portfolio-Project

For this project, we were to complete the HashMap implementation by using the provided skeleton 
code. We used a dynamic array and singly linked list to implement both of the HashMap.  We 
implemented 2 different types of hash maps, one utilizing open addressing and the other using 
single chaining.  The specifics of the requirements are listed in the PDF document.
